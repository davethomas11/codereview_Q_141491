# codereview_Q_141491

These scripts are for generating an SVG path for a circle using bezier curve C commands.

The reason for this script was to create a circle path for an Android VectorDrawable.
I am animating an Android VectorDrawable of a circle into to a square. 
I needed the computer's help via this script to do the math of circle coordinates.

I ended up reusing this script, when I had similiar animations to create. 

If you'd like to see the resulting xml of the two states of the vector drawables please comment,
and I will add them.
